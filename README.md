# 4068ProjectBots
For MQ Uni subject MTRN4068 Final Project.
By: Byron Brake, Ben Cah and Jonathan Barrett

##Goals
Our goal for this project is to create a system that links an app wirelessly to 2 different types of cars that both run off Raspberry Pis.  These different cars are a standard RC car, and a 3 wheel omni-directional style of vehicle.  Further from this we aim to add semi-autonomous and fully autonomous commands and outputs to this system.  A full comprehensive list of our goals and what has been completed is below.

- [ ] Camera feed to app
- [ ] Remote control of both vehicles
- [ ] Vehicle selection code
- [ ] Collision detection with range finding
- [ ] Object detection through camera
- [ ] "Cruise Control" function to follow an object

This list will remain updated as the project progresses.

##How to use
All this code should be able to be used fairly simply once deployed on a Raspberry Pi.  We have designed this specifically using a Pi 3 A+.  You may experience other things happening if your sensors and technology is different to ours, however we have made sure our information for all sensors is fairly accessible and easily changeable.  Commented in the code will be where to change things for different vehicles' sensors.

Once code is deployed and working, it will allow you to complete any of the functions that are completed via an app, when we have this app, further information will be provided on how to obtain it.

##Progress
Here will be a brief update list of what changes get made, with a full log being available elsewhere.

###Update 1
